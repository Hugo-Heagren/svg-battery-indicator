#+title: svg-battery-indicator.el

This is a simple package for generating an SVG battery indicator for
us in the mode-line or tab-bar. It's not on MELPA or Gnu Elpa, so
you'll have to install it manually, or using a GitHub helper like
straight. See the top right of the screen-shot below:

This package requires Emacs to be built with SVG support. You can test
this by running ~(image-type-available-p 'svg)~. If you get ~t~, you
have SVG support.

* Usage
The indicator takes advantage of ~display-battery-mode~ (and the
~battery.el~ library generally). Add
~svg-battery-indicator-set-mode-string~ to ~battery-update-functions~,
and then use ~battery-display-mode~ as normal. You might have
something like this in your ~init.el~:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-to-list 'battery-update-functions
	       'svg-battery-indicator-set-mode-string)

  (display-battery-mode)

  ;; To display in the mode-line
  (add-to-list 'mode-line-format
	       'battery-mode-line-string)

  ;; To display in the tab-bar
  (add-to-list 'tab-bar-format
	       'battery-mode-line-string)
#+end_src

* Customization
The variable ~svg-battery-indicator-length~ sets the length of the
indicator. Otherwise all customization is through ~battery.el~. The
indicator uses the threshholds set in ~battery-load-low~ and
~battery-load-critical~, and represents them with the foreground
colours from the faces ~battery-load-low~ and ~battery-load-critical~.
